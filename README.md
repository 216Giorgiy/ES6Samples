# ES6Samples
==========

A set of ECMAScript 6 examples as well as a Gulp file that converts them to ES5 using Traceur and/or Babel.

## To run the samples:

1. Install Node.js

1. Run `npm install`

1. Run `gulp` to transpile ES6 to ES5 (leave the window open since it watches for file changes)

1. Open another console window and run `npm start` to launch the browser
